# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items
- **Customer Support Input**: Customer Support Liaison provides summary of support trends, recurring customer issues, and incident data to inform improvement priorities

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Include Customer Support Liaison** when retrospective follows a release or incident to ensure customer impact is represented
- Customer Support Liaison shares customer feedback, support ticket trends, and feature requests
- Release Manager (if applicable) provides deployment metrics and release-specific learnings

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
