# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub! This README provides an overview of our unified project management processes and serves as your central navigation point for all process documents.

## Summary

OctoAcme uses a practical, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes clear roles, measurable outcomes, stakeholder alignment, and continuous improvement. Our methodology spans the full project lifecycle—from initial concept through delivery and retrospective—with a focus on delivering customer value through repeatable, transparent execution.

## Core Principles

Our project management approach is built on these foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk and enable feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead roles with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Project Lifecycle

The OctoAcme project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible flow:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight project charter
2. **Planning** — Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and establish timelines
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with daily coordination and weekly progress tracking
4. **Release** — Deploy with confidence using standardized processes, smoke tests, and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective** — Capture learnings, celebrate wins, and identify actionable improvements

## Purpose of This Documentation Hub

These process documents exist to:

- **Improve discoverability**: Provide a single source of truth for how OctoAcme runs projects
- **Accelerate onboarding**: Help new team members quickly understand roles, workflows, and expectations
- **Enable best practices**: Offer practical checklists, templates, and concrete guidance for common scenarios
- **Support repeatable execution**: Reduce friction and uncertainty by documenting proven approaches
- **Drive transparency**: Keep stakeholders informed with consistent communication patterns
- **Foster continuous improvement**: Capture and share learnings across projects and teams

## Process Documents

Each document below offers practical checklists, templates, and concrete guidance for running projects the OctoAcme way. We recommend reading the overview first, then diving into specific lifecycle phases as needed.

### Foundation

- **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** — Introduction to OctoAcme's approach, core roles, key artifacts, and communication cadence
- **[Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** — Detailed responsibilities and goals for Developers, Product Managers, Project Managers, UX Designers, Release Managers, Data Analysts, and Customer Support Liaisons

### Project Lifecycle

- **[Project Initiation](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** — Validate business needs, align stakeholders, create project charter, and get approval to proceed
- **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** — Break work into actionable increments, estimate effort, identify dependencies, and create release plans
- **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** — Manage day-to-day delivery with standups, demos, quality gates, and progress tracking
- **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** — Identify and mitigate risks, maintain stakeholder alignment, and escalate blockers effectively
- **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** — Deploy features to production safely with pre-release requirements, smoke tests, and rollback plans
- **[Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** — Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements after sprints, releases, or incidents

## How to Use These Documents

- **For new team members**: Start with the Project Management Overview and Roles and Personas documents to understand the big picture
- **For project kickoffs**: Reference the Project Initiation and Project Planning guides to ensure you cover all critical steps
- **During active delivery**: Use Execution & Tracking and Risk Management & Communication for day-to-day operations
- **For releases**: Follow the Release & Deployment checklist to minimize risk and ensure smooth deployments
- **After milestones**: Run structured retrospectives using the Continuous Improvement guide to capture learnings

Each document includes:
- **Checklists** to ensure nothing is missed
- **Templates** for common artifacts (one-pagers, status updates, risk registers, etc.)
- **Concrete guidance** on when and how to apply each process

## Continuous Improvement

These documents are living artifacts. As OctoAcme evolves, so should our processes. We encourage all team members to:

- Suggest improvements based on real project experiences
- Share feedback on what's working and what isn't
- Contribute templates and examples that help the team
- Update documentation as new best practices emerge

By following these processes and continuously refining them, we create a foundation for predictable, high-quality delivery that scales with our team and our ambitions.
